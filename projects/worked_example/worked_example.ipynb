    "### Algorithmic thinking\n",
    "With our current imported python packages we can not simply solve any arbitary qudratic equation for the roots. Consequenctly we need to write such a function our self. To do this we need to utlize simple mathmatical rules to solve for the roots. This process, of utilizing simple mathmatical and logical expression to solve a problem of more complex nature, is called `Algorithmic thinking`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following; we will attempt to outline and identify the individual steps to solve for the roots of a qudratic equation using algorithmic thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to a qudratic on the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a} \\tag{eq. 1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "With the expression $D=b^2 - 4 a c$ known as the discriminant. From the discriminant we know the number of roots to search for according to the following rules:\n",
    "* $D > 0$: 2 real roots\n",
    "* $D = 0$: 1 real root\n",
    "* $D < 0$: 2 complex roots\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, once we have the result of the discriminant we know the number of roots we have to seach for. To get the correct number of roots we can make an algorhtm like the following:\n",
    "1. From the values $a$,$b$, and $c$ determine the discriminant $D$.\n",
    "2. Determine the first root (x1) using  $x1 = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a}$.\n",
    "3. We make a conditional statement based on the discriminant $D$:\n",
    "    1. If $D$ is not equal to 0 we solve for the second root (x2) using $x2 = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a}$ and return the roots x1 and x2 \n",
    "    2. Else we return the root x1.\n",
    "   \n",
