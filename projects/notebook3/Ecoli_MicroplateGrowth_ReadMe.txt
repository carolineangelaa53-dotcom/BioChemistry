###### Comments ######
Readme Associated with Ecoli_MicroplateGrowth_XC_Raw and Ecoli_MicroplateGrowth_XC_Filtered, where X is the temperature in degree Celsius of the experiment.
Each file corresponds to one experiment with E. coli growth data in modified MOPS medium with 500 mg/L glucose.
Data in column n°1 in the files correspond to time of the experiments in hours.
Data in columns n°2-49 correspond to OD measurements without blank in microplates wells. A-F and 1-8 represent, respectively, row and column labels of each well on the microplate.
Wells A7, A8, B7, B8, C7 and C8 were used as controls with modified MOPS medium with 500 mg/L glucose without inoculation.
Wells D7 and D8 were used as inoculated controls with modified MOPS medium but without glucose.
In Ecoli_MicroplateGrowth_XC_Filtered files, columns corresponding to wells without growth (either controls or wells for which growth was not observed) were removed.
