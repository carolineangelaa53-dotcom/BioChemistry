So can e.g. method 1 (x-axis) not separate the black, yellow and green signatures, while the second method (axis 2) can not separate blue and yellow peak. In this sketch the two methods are very nicely \"othogonal\" meaning that e.g. the green, yellow and black features are perfectly aligned, in general this is of course not assumed. Plotting the two methods in a 2d image as shown here allows a visible inspection of  the two analysis runs and one can \"see\" the different compounds. But how do we quantitatively extract e.g. what fraction of each compound is in the mixture we need to extract the information from the image.\n",
